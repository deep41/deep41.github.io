# Load Balanced Service Orchestrator

MixxCloud is a sophisticated service orchestration platform that automates the deployment and management of containerized applications across distributed infrastructure. Using Docker for containerization and Ansible for configuration management, the system provides intelligent load balancing, auto-scaling, and fault tolerance across multiple cloud environments. The platform supports complex networking configurations within VPCs and enables seamless service discovery and communication between distributed components.
