# LeetRevise: Spaced Repetition for Coding Interviews

## Overview

LeetRevise implements the scientifically-proven **spaced repetition learning technique** to optimize coding interview preparation. The platform analyzes user performance patterns and automatically schedules problem reviews at optimal intervals to maximize retention.

## Key Features

### üß† Intelligent Scheduling
- **Adaptive Algorithm**: Problems are scheduled based on your performance history
- **Optimal Intervals**: Reviews are timed to maximize long-term retention
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: The system adapts to your learning pace

### üìä Performance Analytics
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed statistics on solving patterns
- **Weak Area Identification**: Automatically identifies topics that need more practice
- **Performance Trends**: Visual charts showing improvement over time

### üéØ Personalized Recommendations
- **Smart Problem Selection**: AI-powered recommendations based on your skill gaps
- **Topic-Based Learning**: Organized by data structures and algorithms
- **Difficulty Progression**: Gradual increase in problem complexity

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
Frontend (React + TypeScript)
    ‚Üì
API Layer (Node.js + Express)
    ‚Üì
Database (MongoDB)
    ‚Üì
Spaced Repetition Engine
```

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, JWT Authentication
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Algorithm**: Custom spaced repetition implementation based on SM-2

### Key Algorithms

#### Spaced Repetition Formula
The system uses a modified version of the SM-2 algorithm:

```javascript
nextInterval = previousInterval * easeFactor
easeFactor = Math.max(1.3, easeFactor + (0.1 - (5 - quality) * (0.08 + (5 - quality) * 0.02)))
```

Where:
- `quality`: User's performance rating (0-5)
- `easeFactor`: Difficulty multiplier for the problem
- `previousInterval`: Days since last review

## User Impact

### Statistics
- **35+ Active Users**: Growing community of interview candidates
- **Average Improvement**: 40% increase in problem-solving speed
- **Retention Rate**: 85% of users continue using after first week
- **Success Stories**: Multiple users landed jobs at FAANG companies

### User Testimonials
> "LeetRevise helped me identify my weak areas and focus my practice. I went from struggling with medium problems to solving them confidently in interviews." - *Software Engineer at Google*

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] **Mobile App**: React Native implementation
- [ ] **Video Solutions**: Integrated explanation videos
- [ ] **Peer Learning**: Community features and discussions
- [ ] **Mock Interviews**: AI-powered interview simulation
- [ ] **Company-Specific Prep**: Tailored problem sets for different companies

### Technical Roadmap
- [ ] **Microservices Architecture**: Break down monolithic backend
- [ ] **Real-time Features**: WebSocket integration for live features
- [ ] **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning for better recommendations
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching and CDN
